Docker Is a containerization software using which we can create containers.

Docker is for Devlepors, Admins(DevOps) to build and run applications as contianers.

Docker Editions:

Docker CE --> Comunity Edition --> Open Source(Free)

Docker EE --> Enterprise Edition --> Commercial

Type: Containerization
Vendor: Docker INC

O.S --> Cross Platform(Docker can be installed in any O.S)

Docker Can Be Installed in Linux, Windows OS ,mac OS  

Docker CE Can be installed in Most of the linux except redhat.

Docker EE can installed in all O.S including redhat.

Docker CE --> OpenSouce Free

Docker EE --> Commerical
   DTR --> Docker Trusted Registry(Private Repo to main docker images)
   UCP --> Universal Controll Pane --> It's GUI for managing Docker Machines

Docker,CoreOS,Rockert --> Containerzation Platforms/Softwares.



Dockerfile --> Dockerfile is file which contains instructions to create an image. Which contains 
               Docker Domain Specific Key Words to build image.
			
		   
DockerImage --> It's a package which contains everything(Softwares+ENV+Application Code) to run your application.

DockerContainer --> Run time instance of an image.If you run docker image container will be created
                    that's where our application(process) is running.
DockerRegistriy/Repository

DockerRepo/Registry. --> We can store and share the docker images.

Public Repo --> Docker hub is a public reposotiry. Which contains all the open source softwares as 
a docker images. We can think of docker hub as play store for docker images.


Private Repo(Nexus,JFrog,D.T.R(Docker Trusted Registory)),AWS ECR  --> We can store and share the docker images with in our company
network using private repo

Docker Enigine/Daemon/Host --> It's a software or program using which we can create images & contianers.

Docker is cross platform.

Docker CE
   Docker CE will not be supported by Redhat.
   
 
Docker EE
  Docker EE will be support most of the os including redhat.

      
First Create Account in docker hub
https://hub.docker.com

What is docker hub?
It's a public repository for docker images. You can think as play store for
docker images.

Inspect Docker Image
==================
docker image inspect <imageId/Name>

docker inspect <imageId/Name>

How to list only layers of an image?
docker history <imageId/Name>


Delete Image

docker rmi <imageId/Name>

docker rmi -f <imageId/Name>




Note: We cann't remove images if there are running container for the image.We cann't force delete images if there is running container.

If container is in stopped(exited) state we can force delete image for the stopped container.

what is dangling images in docker?
The image which doesn't have repository mapping or tag.

How to delete all the images?
docker rmi -f imageId imageId imageId

docker rmi -f $(docker images -q)

docker system prune 
Will delete all stopped containers , unused docker networks and dangling images.

docker image prune

Will delete angling images.

We can tag image with repo.

# We can use docker tag to tag images with multiple repo.
docker tag <ImageId/ExistingImageName> <ImageName>


What is working directory of docker?
/var/lib/docker


How can we move/copy images from one server to another server with out repo?

In Source Server(where you have image)
# It save image(All the layers) as a tar file

docker save -o <fileName>.tar <imageName/Id>


Then SCP tar file from Source Server to Destination Server

# In destination server
docker load -i <fileName>.tar


List Dangling images

docker images -f dangling=true

Remove Dangling Images
docker rmi $(docker images -f dangling=true -q)


docker system prune 

This will remove:
  - all stopped containers
  - all networks not used by at least one container
  - all dangling images

docker image prune
This will remove:
- all dangling images

docker contianer prune
This will remove:
  - all stopped containers

docker network prune
This will remove:
  - all networks not used by at least one container
  
  
  
Create ECR in AWS.
  
Note: Replcae your ECR URL when with 935840844891.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com when u create and push.
ECR
===
docker build -t 935840844891.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/maven-web-app

# Authentication with ECR
aws ecr get-login-password --region ap-south-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 935840844891.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com  


Note: Create IAM Role with required policy and attach to EC2 Servers.

# IAM Policiy to autheticate and pull & Push image.
AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess

# IAM Policiy to autheticate and pull image.
AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly





Container Commands:
===================
How to create a contianer?

docker run or docker create

docker create --name <containerName> -p <hostPort>:<containerPort> <imageName>


docker run --name <containerName> -p <hostPort>:<containerPort> <imageName>

# Create a container in dettached mode
docker run -d --name <containerName> -p <hostPort>:<containerPort> <imageName>

what is the difference b/w docker run and docker create?

docker create will only create a container but it will not start the container.
docker run will create a container and start the container.

what is port publish or port mapping in docker ?
If We have to access application which is running as container from out side of docker we can't access using continerIP & ContainerPort. We can publish contianer port using host port using -p or --publish.
So that we can access using HostIP(docker server IP) and Host Port from outside docker.


docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name mavenwebapp  dockerhandson/maven-web-application

Access Application which is running Using  Docker Server IP & Host Port.

http://<DOCKERSERVERPUBLICIP>:<HOSTPORT>/maven-web-application


# How to create container in interactive mode?

docker run -it --name <nameofthecontainer>  <image>

List Running Containers
=======================

docker ps 
docker container ls

List All Containers
==================

docker ps -a

docker container ls -a

List only running container ids
==============================

docker ps -q

docker container ls -q


List all container ids
==============================

docker ps -aq

docker container ls -aq


Start the container
===================
docker start <containerId/Name>


Restart Container

docker restart <containerId/Name>

Stop Container

docker stop <containerId/Name>


Kill container

docker kill <containerId/Name>

What is the difference b/w docker stop & docker kill?

docker stop will first send SIGTERM then SIGKILL it will kill process with grace period. Docker kill send SIGKILL it will kill process with out any grace period.

Can we have/run more than one process in a container?
Yes Can we have. But it's not suggestable. 


Pause contaier process.

docker pause <containerId/Name>

docker unpuase <containerId/Name>

Inspect container
docker inspect <containerId/Name>
docker container inspect <containerId/Name>


It will  container if it is stopped.
docker rm  <containerId/Name>

Force Remove If container is runing we can force remove
docker rm -f <containerId/Name>


How to delete only stopped containers
docker rm $(docker ps -aq --filter  status="exited")

How to delete all containers
docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)

How to trouble shoot or debug application which is running as a container?

docker logs <containerId/Name>
docker logs --tail <NoOflines> <containerId/Name>

# It will display process details which is runing inside a container.
docker top <containerId/Name>

# It will display resource(RAM,CPU) consumtion details.
docker stats <containerId/Name>

# Execute commands on a runinging container.
docker exec <containerId/Name> <cmd>

ex:
docker exec javawebapp ls
docker exec javawebapp pwd

How to go inside a container?

docker exec -it <containerId/Name> /bin/bash
 
       or

docker exec -it <containerId/Name> /bin/sh

# Docker attach will attach container process or shell to host server
docker attach <containerId/Name>

If we have to come out with out stoping the process cntl p+q.

How to copy files from container to host system or host system to container?

docker cp

Container to the system

docker cp <containerName>:</pathOftheContainerFile>  <SystemPath>/<fileName>

docker cp javawebappone:/usr/local/tomcat/logs/catalina.2020-04-23.log  javawebappone.log

system to the Container 

docker cp  <SystemPath>/<fileName><containerName>:</pathOftheContainerFile> 

docker cp  /home/ubunut/test.log javawebappone:/usr/local/tomcat/logs/test.log



What is difference b/w COPY and docker cp?
COPY is a docker file insturction using which we can copy files to image.
docker cp is a command using which we can files from system to container or container to system.


docker rename <ContainerId/NameOld> <NewName>

What is docker commit?
Using docker commit we can create image from the continer.

docker commit <containerId/Name> <imageName>

Can we set CPU,RAM limit for the containers while creating?
Yes We set using options while creating a container.

# Search images in repos
docker search <imageName>

docker search tomcat






Image is package (AppCode+ Softwares)
Cotainer is a running process of an image.

If you have to crate docker image we need a dockerfile.


Dockerfile --> Dockerfile is file which contians instructions(Docker Domain Specific KeyWords) to create an image. 
Docker Daemon  will process these instruction from top to bottom.



EX:

FROM tomcat:8.0.20-jre8
COPY target/java-web-app*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/java-web-app.war


DockerImage --> It's package which contains application code + all it's dependencies(Software+ENV Varibles + Config Files) together.


Dockerfile keywords
===================

FROM

MAINTAINER

COPY

ADD

RUN

CMD

ENTRYPOINT

WORKDIR

ENV

EXPOSE

USER

VOLUME

LABEL

ARG



FROM --> FROM indicates the image base image which we are using to build our own image.


Syntax: 
FROM  <ImageName>

Ex:

FROM tomcat:8.0.20-jre8(Software)

FROM openjdk:8-alpine


MAINTAINER --> It's will be used as commnets to describe author/owner who is maintaning docker file.

MAINTAINER MithunTech <devopstrainingblr@gmail.com>


COPY --> Using COPY we can copy files/folders to the image. Files/Folders will be copied while creating an image.
It will copy local files from host server(docker server)from where we are building image to the image while creating a image.

SYTNAX:
======
COPY <source>                <destination> 
      ServerFile/FolderPath   PathInsideImage
EX:
COPY target/java-web-app.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/java-web-app.war

# Below also valid it will copy all the files/folder from HOST Machine current working
directory to Image working dirctroy.
COPY . .

ADD --> ADD also can copy files to the image while creating image. ADD can copy local files from host server and also it can download files from remote HTTP/S locations while creating a image.
		
ADD <URL> <destination>

ADD <source> <destination>

EX:

# File from http(s) location
ADD https://downloads.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.5.54/bin/apache-tomcat-8.5.54.zip /opt/ 

# Local file
ADD target/java-web-app.war  /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/java-web-app.war

Note: If it's tar file ADD will copy file and also it will extract tar file.

RUN ,CMD, ENTRYPOINT instruncations can be used to execute commands.

RUN --> RUN instruncation  will  execute commands .RUN commands or instructions will be executed while creating an image. Next to run you can mention any command based on base os of image.
We can have n number RUN instructions in a docker file all the RUN instructions will be exectued one after the other from top to bottom.

Syntax: 
#Shell Form
RUN <commond with args> 
#Executable Form
RUN ["commond" , "Arg1","Arg2"]

EX:
RUN mkdir -p /opt/app				
RUN tar -xvzf /opt/apache-tomcat-8.5.54.tar.gz 


CMD  --> CMD instruncation will execute commands. CMD commands or instructions will be executed while creating a container.CMD insturction can be used to start the process inside the container.

#Shell Form
CMD <commond with args> 
#Executable Form
CMD ["commond" , "Arg1","Arg2"]

# Shell Form
CMD java -jar springapplication.jar. 
# Executable form
CMD ["java", "-jar" , "springapplication.jar"] 


What is difference b/w RUN & CMD?

RUN instructions will be executed while creating a image. CMD Instructions will be executed while creating a
container.We can have more than one RUN keyword in a docker file. All the RUN keywords will be processed while creating an image in the defined order(top to bottom).

Can we have more than one CMD in dockerfile?
Yes you can have. But only the last one/recent one in the order will be proccessed while creating a container.


ENTRYPOINT --> ENTRYPOINT instruncation will execute commands. ENTRYPOINT commands or instructions will be executed while creating a container.


ENTRYPOINT java -jar springapplication.jar. # Shell Form

ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar" , "springapplication.jar"] # Executable form


What is the diffrence b/w CMD & ENTRYPOINT ?

CMD command/instruction can be overridden while creating a container. ENTRYPOINT command/instruction can't be
overridden while creating a container.




Can we have both CMD & ENTRYPOINT in docker file? 

Yes we can have both in a docker file. CMD instructions will not be executed if we have both CMD & ENTRYPOINT.CMD instructions will be passed as an arguments for ENTRYPOINT.

FOR Example:
CMD ls
ENTRYPOINT ["echo", "Hello"]

IT Will be executed as below
/bin/echo HELLO ls 

# Out Put
Hello ls

Requirement always we have to execute sh catalina.sh . But argument by default it has to execute "start". But dynamically i should a option to pass different argument while creating a container.

CMD start
ENTRYPOINT ["sh", "catalina.sh"]

Docker Networks

What is network ?
Group of servers will be connected to each other in a specific network. If Servers
are in same network each one can talk to another server.

Docker network

If One Container has to talk to another Container in Docker. Both has to created under
same docker network.

If Containers are in two different networks. They can't accees each other.


In which docker network the container will be created if we don't mention network name while
creating a container ?

Containers will be created in a default bridge network.
If we don't mention network name while creating a container.

How to list networks in docker?

docker network ls

Docker will have 3 networks by default.
bridge(default)
host
none/null


docker run -d --name javawebapp -p 8080:8080 dockerhandson/java-web-app

docker run -d --name mavenwebapp dockerhandson/maven-web-app


If containers are created in a default bridge network. Communcation will happen only
with IP Address of container. Communcation will not happen using containerName(hostName).

To Check Go inside javawebapp container and ping mavenwebapp container using name & ip. When we ping using ip it will work it will not able to communicate using name.


Developers should not code the connectivity based on the IP in case of contianers. Since IP address of cotnainers will be dynamic.
IP will keep changing.

How to create a custom bridge network ?

# Create Network
Syntax: docker network create -d <driver> <networkName>

Ex: 
docker network create -d bridge flipkartnetwork

# Inspect network
docker network inspect <networkNameOrId>

If containers are created in custom bridge network. Each container can access other using containerName/ContainerIP.

# Delete Containers which are running in default bridge or create container with different name.

docker run -d --name javawebapp -p 8080:8080  --network flipkartnetwork dockerhandson/java-web-app

docker run -d --name mavenwebapp  --network flipkartnetwork dockerhandson/maven-web-app

Create both containers in same network and try to ping mongo contaner with name & IP  from sprinapp container or vice versa it will work with both.




Another Application

# Create Network if not exists
docker run -d --name mongo -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=devdb -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=devdb1234  --network flipkartnetwork mongo

docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name springapp  -e MONGO_DB_HOSTNAME=mongo -e MONGO_DB_USERNAME=devdb -e MONGO_DB_PASSWORD=devdb1234 --network flipkartnetwork  dockerhandson/spring-boot-mongo



# Remove unused networks
docker network prune 

# Remove Network
docker network rm <networkNameOrId>

Docker Host Network.

If we create contaienrs in host network. Container will not have IP Address. Container will be created
in a system network.

But we can't create more than one cotnainer with same container port in host network.We no need to do port publish to access
containers.


Docker none/null network

If we create contaienrs in none/null network. Container will not have IP Address.We can't 
accees these contianers from out side or from any other cotnainer.


We connect container to more than one network by using docker connect.

docker network connect <networkName/Id>  <containerName/Id>

docker network disconnect <networkName/Id>  <containerName/Id>




Docker Volumes

Volumes:
=======

 Create docker network using below commond(If it's not created already)

     docker network create  -d bridge springappnetwork

  Create a mongo contianer with out volume in above network
	 	 
	 docker run -d --name mongo -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=devdb -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=devdb1234  --network springappnetwork mongo

 Create Spring Application Container in above network & which will talk to mongo data base container

       docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name springapp  -e MONGO_DB_HOSTNAME=mongo -e MONGO_DB_USERNAME=devdb -e MONGO_DB_PASSWORD=devdb1234 --network springappnetwork dockerhandson/spring-boot-mongo
    
	 
 Access Spring application & insert data it will be inserted to mongo db. Delete and recreate mongo container 
   what ever you have inserted will no longer be availbale. As once we delete contaienr data also will be deleted
   in container.
   
   To take maitain state (date) of container we have to use volunmes
